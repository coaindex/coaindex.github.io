<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: For our guest tonight, I’d like to welcome a representative of a mysterious group that all of us, even those at home, certainly have many questions about: The Federation. Please welcome Cucurucho!</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><i>Applause sounds as heavy footsteps are heard crossing the stage. There is a slight shuffling noise as CUCURUCHO settles into a chair. </i></p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Hello, Cucurucho. How are you doing today?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO (ROBOTIC): I am well. How are you, [REDACTED]?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: I’m also doing well! Thank you very much for being here today.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: It is nice to meet you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Wonderful. Let’s start with a brief self-introduction. Not many people know who you are outside of your work with the Federation. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: I am Cucurucho. I am often on managerial duty. I work closely with the Federation to ensure everyone’s happiness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Well, let’s start with basics. What’s your favorite food?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: I do not eat, but I enjoy looking at cupcakes. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Is there anything you enjoy doing in your free time?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: I am happy when everyone else is happy and safe. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: What about your dislikes? Everyone has a pet peeve.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: I do not like it when someone breaks the rules. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: What happens then?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: I have to clean up the mess. And the culprit needs to be punished. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Punished?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: Yes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Has there been anything on your mind recently?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: Yes. I want everyone to know that we are working hard to ensure that they are happy and safe. The reason why I am here is to announce our new project. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Oh? Please go on.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: There is a new branch under construction. It is to be called the Coalition. This new branch is going to be overseeing a new SMP. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: A new SMP? Where?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: Serendipity SMP. A land ruled by lost souls and ancient denizens. Inexplicably, players have been showing up there without knowing how. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><i>Static suddenly builds, almost drowning out the voices.</i></p>

<p style="text-align:center">INTERVIEWER: Interesting. Are they going to be okay?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">CUCURUCHO: With our intervention, yes. Their minds are already beginning to be-</p>
